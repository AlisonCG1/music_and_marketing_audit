# Music & Marketing Audit Dashboard

An end-to-end data pipeline and dashboard for analyzing Spotify, Deezer, and YouTube music trends.
Built with DBT, PostgreSQL, and Streamlit for marketing + music insights.

The goal of the project is to create a database that can be used to analyze the intersection of music and marketing through data collected from YouTube, Spotify, and Deezer. These platforms are the main place where people discover music, how artists get noticed, and how viral campaigns take off. By pulling together and making sense of data from these sources, Iâ€™m aiming to uncover insights thatâ€™ll help artists, marketers, and record labels spot trends, connect with audiences, and boost their promotional game.

This capstone will demonstrate how modern data engineering tools and workflows can be applied to real-world datasets. The final product will include a set of dashboards and reports that allow stakeholders (e.g., artists, music marketers, record labels) to understand the marketing performance of songs, identify high-engagement content, and forecast potential hits.
